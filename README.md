# BUCKETLIST DESCRIPTION
Bucketlist is a Sinatra-based web app that allows users to create an account to track their bucketlists. Users can create life and seasonal bucketlists, and through these bucketlists, can access a list of travel locations that they have been to, those upcoming through their bucketlists as well as a map for each location. Bucketlist experiences can be added, edited, and viewed, and their statuses can be updated from "need to do" to "done!" (as well as back to "need to do", if necessary.)



# INSTALL AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
To use Bucketlist, fork and clone the repository. CD to the local repository files, run bundle install, and then run shotgun from the terminal. In your web browser, navigate to the appropriate localhost, and you can access Bucketlist from there.
